### Approach followed
> using recursion to get the string expression instaed of using switch case use the operator chan as it is 
>
> Use toString function to get the expression, then replace sthe char 'x' and 'รท' as they are not read by compiler while performing calculation then use math library to evalute the result
>
> seprating toString, result function from Node
>
> using `try/catch` blocks to handle the errors.
